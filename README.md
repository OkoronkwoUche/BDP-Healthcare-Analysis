# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
___
Data Collection: The dataset was provided by Data Analytics Elite Global Community, which includes key attributes like patient’s name, age, gender, blood type, medical condition, date of admission, doctor, hospital, insurance provider, billing amount, room number, admission type, discharge date, medication and test results.

Data cleaning: The data cleaning process included data validation and standardization and data formatting to maintain data consistency. Data cleaning process was carried out using Power Query In PowerBI.

Data Modeling: The file was split into three to carve out a fact table and two dimension tables. The star schema was used in Power BI to improve analysis accuracy and optimized the overall dashboard performance.

Descriptive Analysis: Used statistical measure to analyze the healthcare data across various patient demographics like (name, age, gender, medical condition, blood group, etc.) in other to fully understand our patient base. 

Advanced DAX Functions: Utilized Power BI’s advanced DAX functions to query and to analyze both numeric and categorical data that influences patients and their use of the healthcare facilities among other factors. 

Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to display key metrics, trends, correlations and influencers.
