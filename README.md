# INTRODUCTION
___
Healthcare is one of the most important sector of human society. Healthcare analysis involves the systematic examination of data related to health services to improve decision-making, enhance patient outcomes, and optimize operational efficiency within healthcare systems. This analysis was done by leveraging various analytical techniques to uncover trends, identify areas for improvement, and support evidence-based policy and clinical decisions.
___
# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
___
The goal of this project is to identify trends and correlations in hospital admissions, billing, and medical conditions across different dimensions such as gender, age, insurance providers, and treatment outcomes. This analysis will help in improving hospital management decisions, optimizing patient care, and minimizing costs.
___
# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
___
Data Collection: The dataset was provided by Data Analytics Elite Global Community, which includes key attributes like patient’s name, age, gender, blood type, medical condition, date of admission, doctor, hospital, insurance provider, billing amount, room number, admission type, discharge date, medication and test results.

Data cleaning: The data cleaning process included data validation and standardization and data formatting to maintain data consistency. Data cleaning process was carried out using Power Query In PowerBI.

Data Modeling: The file was split into three to carve out a fact table and two dimension tables. The star schema was used in Power BI to improve analysis accuracy and optimized the overall dashboard performance.

Descriptive Analysis: Used statistical measure to analyze the healthcare data across various patient demographics like (name, age, gender, medical condition, blood group, etc.) in other to fully understand the patient base. 

Advanced DAX Functions: Utilized Power BI’s advanced DAX functions to query and to analyze both numeric and categorical data that influences patients and their use of the healthcare facilities among other factors. 

Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to display key metrics, trends, correlations and influencers.

# KEY INSIGHTS
___
•	Urgent admissions show consistent variations throughout the year.
•	Elective and emergency admissions exhibit fluctuations with noticeable peaks in certain months (e.g., October and April).
•	Obesity and hypertension have the highest average length of stays (16 days each).
•	Arthritis and asthma patients have relatively shorter stays (15 days each).
•	Most of the patients fell within the age group of retirees and who were women had more admission cases than men.
  Women had more cases of asthma, cancer, obesity and diabetes while men had more cases of hypertension and arthritis.

# RECOMMENDATIONS & CONCLUSION
___
The following recommendations were made:
With urgent admissions varying throughout the year and peaks in elective and emergency during October and April, hospitals should enhance staffing, equipment readiness, and bed availability during those high-demand months.

Focus on Preventive Programs for obesity and hypertension. Since obesity and hypertension contribute to the longest hospital stays, hospitals can implement community education and wellness programs focusing on lifestyle changes, early diagnosis and disease managment to reduce in-patient length of stay.

Introduce targeted screening for obesity, hypertension, asthma, cancer and diabetes within the high-risk group(e.g. retireees and women)
